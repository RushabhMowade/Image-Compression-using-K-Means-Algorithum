# Image-Compression-using-K-Means-Algorithum

---

This project focuses on implementing **image compression** through the **K-Means clustering algorithm**, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for data segmentation. The main objective is to reduce the number of unique colors in an image while retaining its overall visual quality.

Using **predefined K-Means functions**, the algorithm analyzes the RGB color values of each pixel and groups them into **16 color clusters** based on similarity. Each cluster represents a dominant color in the image, and all pixels belonging to a cluster are replaced by the cluster’s centroid color. This process effectively compresses the image, as it drastically reduces the color palette from thousands of colors to only 16, leading to a smaller file size.

The project demonstrates how **K-Means can be applied beyond numerical data** to solve real-world problems like image compression, data reduction, and pattern recognition. It also highlights the balance between **compression efficiency and visual quality**, showing that even with limited colors, the reconstructed image preserves the original structure and appearance remarkably well.
